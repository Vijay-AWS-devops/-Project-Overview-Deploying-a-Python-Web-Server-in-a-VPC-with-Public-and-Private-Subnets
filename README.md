# -Project-Overview-Deploying-a-Python-Web-Server-in-a-VPC-with-Public-and-Private-Subnets
Deploy a Python web server on EC2 in a private subnet. Set up a VPC with public and private subnets across two AZs. Use a bastion host for secure access, an Auto Scaling Group for backend EC2s, and a Load Balancer in the public subnet. NAT Gateways enable private instances to access the internet securely.
